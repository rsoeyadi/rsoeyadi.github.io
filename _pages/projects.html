<h2>Juilcal</h2>
<!-- <img src="../assets/images/juilcal.jpg"/> -->
<b><a href="https://juilcal.com" target="_blank">
        Juilcal</a></b> is a lightweight, filtered search web application for Juilliardâ€™s performance calendar. I built
a REST
API
using Flask that allows for users to enter multiple keywords when querying events. Data is fetched through a Python web
scraper that I wrote to save all Juilliard events into database using BeautifulSoup4 and SQLite3.

<h2>Musical Performance Website</h2>
<!-- <img src="../assets/images/ryansoeyadipianist.jpg" /> -->
I designed <b><a href="https://ryansoeyadipianist.com" target="_blank">my professional pianist website</a></b> to
present
biographical
information, photos, videos, blogs, and more using
GatsbyJS and React. The frontend is connected to Contentful to allow for simple content management actions.

<h2>Medtnerdex</h2>
<!-- <img src="../assets/images/medtnerdex.jpg" /> -->

The <b><a href="https://medtnerdex.com" target="_blank">Medtnerdex</a></b> is a small tool built using jQuery and
vanilla
HTML/CSS to organize Nikolai Medtner's compositional
output. The works are stored in JSON format on Google Firebase for easy filtering of works. You are able to view works
organized according to dates and genres using the slider and drop-down menus.
