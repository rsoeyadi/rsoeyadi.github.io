<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="/assets/images/about-photo.jpg" />
<br> 
<p>Welcome! My name is <b>Ryan</b>, and I'm a <b>1st year master's student in Computer Science</b> at the <b>School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University</b> from Long Island, NY.</p>
<p>In addition to computer science, I'm also a classical pianist. I graduated from Juilliard with a bachelor's in piano performance. When I'm not programming or playing piano, I'm probably drinking a cortado.</p>
