<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="/assets/images/about-photo.jpg" />
<br>
<p>Welcome! My name is <b>Ryan</b>, and I'm a <b>1st year master's student in Computer Science</b> at the <b>School of
        Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University</b> from Long Island, NY.</p>
<p>In addition to computer science, I'm also a classical pianist. I graduated from Juilliard with a bachelor's in piano
    performance. When I'm not programming or playing piano, I'm probably drinking a cortado.</p>

<h2>Why I study computer science</h2>
<p>I had an exciting iOS app idea during my junior year at Juilliard and decided that I'd learn how to code and have it up and running within a month! Lo and behold, it turned out that my novel idea was not something that could be quickly done from scratch, especially with no prior knowledge. A few months of intense research led me to my decision to pursue a graduate degree in computer science at Columbia, the wonderful school that I've been able to develop my computer science foundation at. Courses I've taken include <i>Programming in Java</i>, <i>Data Structures in Java</i>, <i>Advanced Programming</i>, <i>C++ for C Programmers</i>, and <i>Advanced Software Engineering</i>.</p>
<p>
    I'm particularly excited about the possibilities of software development in the arts. There are countless opportunities to develop software to assist musicians, artists, dancers, listeners, and more. My current goal is to learn industry standard software development as an intern this coming summer 2023!
